# Kemper Rater Prototype - Implementation Summary

## Basic Premium Calculation Method - Complete Implementation

This project has completely implemented the basic premium calculation method, including all specified calculation steps and features.

## Implemented Features

### ✅ 1. Base Rate Table System
- **File**: `src/models/rate_table.py`
- **Features**: 
  - Support for date-based rate queries
  - Support for multi-year policy annual rate table switching
  - Support for age range matching (e.g., "25-30", "65+")
  - Support for vehicle type and usage matching
- **Sample Data**: `data/sample_rates.json`

### ✅ 2. Coverage Calculator Engine
- **File**: `src/calculators/coverage_calculator.py`
- **Features**:
  - Calculate each coverage item separately (BI, PD, PIP, UM/UIM, Coll, Comp)
  - Support for annual and multi-year policy calculations
  - Detailed calculation process output

### ✅ 3. Factor/Multiplier System
- **File**: `src/models/factors.py`
- **Features**:
  - Support for multiple factor types (driver age, vehicle type, usage, safety devices, etc.)
  - **Correctly implements factor multiplication**: `Base × Factor1 × Factor2 × Factor3`
  - Support for conditional factor application
  - Support for additive and multiplicative factors

### ✅ 4. Precise Rounding System
- **File**: `src/utils/rounding.py`
- **Features**:
  - Intermediate calculation results rounded to three decimal places
  - Final amounts rounded to integers
  - Uses `Decimal` to ensure precise calculations

### ✅ 5. Pro-rata Term Factor Adjustment
- **File**: `src/utils/term_calculation.py`
- **Features**:
  - Support for non-annual policy term proportion calculations
  - Support for multi-year policy annual breakdown
  - Precise date calculations

### ✅ 6. Main Calculation Orchestrator
- **File**: `src/calculators/premium_calculator.py`
- **Features**:
  - Implements complete calculation formula: `Premium = BaseRate × ∏Factors × TermFactor`
  - Support for multiple policy types (annual, short-term, multi-year)
  - Detailed calculation result reports

## Calculation Formula Implementation

```
Premium = BaseRate × ∏Factors × TermFactor
```

### Calculation Steps:
1. **Find Base Rate**: Query rate table based on policy effective date/renewal date
2. **Calculate Each Item**: Each coverage calculated separately
3. **Apply Factors**: Factor multiplication (not addition)
4. **Step-by-step Rounding**: Intermediate results to three decimal places, final to integer
5. **Term Adjustment**: Non-annual policies adjusted proportionally
6. **Final Rounding**: To nearest dollar

## Supported Coverage Types

- **BI (Bodily Injury)**: Bodily Injury Liability
- **PD (Property Damage)**: Property Damage Liability  
- **PIP (Personal Injury Protection)**: Personal Injury Protection
- **UM (Uninsured Motorist)**: Uninsured Motorist
- **UIM (Underinsured Motorist)**: Underinsured Motorist
- **COLL (Collision)**: Collision Coverage
- **COMP (Comprehensive)**: Comprehensive Coverage

## Supported Factor Types

- **Driver Age Factors**: Young driver surcharge, senior driver surcharge
- **Vehicle Type Factors**: Rate adjustments for different vehicle types
- **Usage Factors**: Commuting, business, agricultural, etc.
- **Safety Device Discounts**: Safety belt, airbag, ABS, etc.
- **Multi-car Discounts**: Discounts for multiple vehicles
- **Accident History Factors**: Rate adjustments based on accident history
- **Violation History Factors**: Rate adjustments based on traffic violations

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from src.calculators.premium_calculator import PremiumCalculator

# Create calculator
calculator = PremiumCalculator(rate_table, factor_engine)

# Calculate total premium
results = calculator.calculate_total_premium(
    coverages, vehicle, drivers, policy_info
)
```

### Run Examples
```bash
python demo.py                    # Basic demo
python examples/basic_usage.py    # Detailed examples
python -m pytest tests/          # Run tests
```

## Test Coverage

- **Unit Tests**: `tests/test_premium_calculation.py`
- **Functional Tests**: Rounding, term calculation, rate queries, factor application
- **Integration Tests**: Complete premium calculation flow
- **Example Tests**: Annual, short-term, multi-year policies
